- 👋 Greetings, I’m `@Fexcraft` aka _Ferdinand Calo'_ aka FEX___96.    
I use the "Fexcraft" name since the username "Ferdinand" is often already occupied on websites,    
and I also wanted to prevent someone else taking the name I use for my stuff and my own website.    
Since I work on most things alone, it works out well enough I guess.
- 👀 I’m interested in Modding, OpenGL, World Building/Management, Game Dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning _many things, whatever I may need at this given time_.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on `<null>`
- 📫 How to reach me: @mail, Discord `Ferdinand#7092`, or check 'Social' tab on my website (VK, Bilibili, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, etc).
